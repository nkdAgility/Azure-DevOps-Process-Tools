# Azure DevOps Process Tools [![Visual Studio Marketplace](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version-short/nkdagility.processtemplate.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nkdagility.processtemplate)

This task automates the Process of managing your Process changes from source control to Azure DevOps so that you can keep all your projects in sync. 

One of the largest issues for Enterprise is everyone using a different process template for their projects. When you move your Collection to Azure DevOps with your custom Process Template you get a "Phase 1 enabled account". This account does not let you edit the Process Template in the UI and instead lets you download and upload the process template.

These build tasks allow you to manage both the XML and Inherited processes in Azure DevOps Services. You can use this task to create a controlled exposure CI/CD Pipeline that deploys and manages your process between Organisations.


## What can you do with this tool?

- **Azure DevOps Services Process (XML)** Task - Upload XML Based Process from an export
- **Azure DevOps Services Process (Inherited)** Task - Migrate Inherited Process(s) between Organisations (uses [https://github.com/Microsoft/process-migrator](https://github.com/Microsoft/process-migrator))
